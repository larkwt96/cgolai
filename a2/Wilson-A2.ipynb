The solution path is built as each recursion layer returns. If the solution is not found, then the for loop actually finishes. If any cutoffs occur, `cutoffOccurred` is set to true. This case implies that a child had more children which couldn't be explored due to the depth limit. In this case, the failure is reported as a `cutoff`. If no cutoffs occur, then every child node was discovered and explored, yet no solution was found, so it therefore reports as a `failure`.\n",
